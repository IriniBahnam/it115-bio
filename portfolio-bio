<h1>Hello, my name is Irini Bahnam</h1>
<p>'m currently in the Quality Assurance track for a program called Year up. I am interested in this field because it will
allow me to learn about production and how to create and maintain its quality.</p>
<p>I am eager to learn more about software development and pursue a degree in the technology field.</p>
<p> I did some self taught programming and received my HTML and CSS certificate in March of 2022. I am excited to be in this program
because it will provide me with the skills needed to land a corporate job.</p>
<p>After successfully completing the Year Up program I plan to work part time while also continuing my education further.</p>
